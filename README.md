# A-Start-Implementation-On-Grid-In-C
A Simple Visualization Of A* Pathfinding Algorithm In Grid Using Simple C

Note This Algorithm Is Not The Most Efficient Implementation Of A* Since Im Using A Linked List To Store The Node Data And Need To Loop Through The Linked List To Find The Smallest H Cost

A Better Implementation Of This Algorithm Will Use A Min-Heap Instead Of A Linked List
